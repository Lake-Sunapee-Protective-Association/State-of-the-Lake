Repository for Lake Sunapee Protective Association State of the Lake report and community-oriented figures

All scripts save to a Dropbox folder, but could be changed to be saved anywhere. Aside from some local spatial files, all LMP and buoy data are pulled from stable DOI sources. At this time, scripts are for miscellaneous figures, some of which may be used in a future SOTL.

folder 'older' contains mostly out-of-date code, but may be helpful architecture to keep for some other time.
